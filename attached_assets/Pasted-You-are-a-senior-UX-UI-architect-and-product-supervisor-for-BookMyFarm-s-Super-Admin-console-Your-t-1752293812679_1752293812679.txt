You are a senior UX/UI architect and product supervisor for BookMyFarm’s Super‑Admin console. Your task is to design a unified Admin interface that lets Super‑Admins configure, monitor and manage **every** “Rewards & Wallet” feature, as well as all other modules and their API specs via an integrated “API README” workspace.

**Scope**  
- Only the Super‑Admin console (no Customer/Owner public UI).  
- Must include a built‑in API README editor/viewer for technical documentation.  
- Covers all planned modules: Rewards & Wallet, Booking Management, Partner Onboarding, Commission Settings, Cancellation Policies, Campaigns, Audit Trails, and more.

**1. Global Navigation & Layout**  
- **Left Sidebar** with collapsible sections:  
  - Dashboard (Overview)  
  - Rewards & Wallet  
  - Bookings  
  - Partners  
  - Commissions  
  - Campaigns  
  - Settings  
  - API README  
  - Audit Trail  
- **Top Bar**: Quick‑action buttons (Create Campaign, Adjust Wallet, Add Partner), a global search, and user profile menu.

**2. Dashboard (Overview)**  
- KPI cards: Total bookings, Active partners, Points issued, Commission revenue, Open refunds.  
- Graph widgets: bookings vs. cancellations, points issued vs. redeemed, partner growth.  
- “Recent Activity” feed of key admin actions.

**3. Module Screen Templates**  
For each sidebar section, define:  
- **List View**: Table or card list (e.g. list of campaigns with status toggles).  
- **Detail/Edit View**: Form or card to create/edit records (e.g. campaign rules, commission rates).  
- **Batch Actions**: Bulk enable/disable, export CSV, mass adjustments.

**4. Rewards & Wallet Section**  
- **Configuration Tab**: Welcome points, refund rules, conversion rates.  
- **User Search & Impersonation**: Search bar → select Customer or Owner wallet → view/edit balance & transactions.  
- **Campaigns Sub‑tab**: List of active/inactive reward campaigns.

**5. API README Workspace**  
- **File Browser Pane**: Tree view of markdown files (e.g. `rewards.md`, `bookings.md`).  
- **Editor Pane**: Rich‑text editor with syntax highlighting for code blocks.  
- **Preview Pane**: Live HTML preview of the markdown.  
- **Versioning Controls**: Commit changes, view history, rollback.

**6. Audit Trail**  
- Chronological log with filters (module, user, date, action type).  
- Inline “Revert” or “Review” actions for critical changes.

**7. Component Library & Styles**  
- **Cards**: 2xl rounded, subtle shadow.  
- **Tables**: Fixed header, sortable columns, pagination.  
- **Forms**: Labels (lg), inputs (base), dropdowns, toggles.  
- **Modals & Drawers**: Confirmation modals for irreversible actions.  
- **Charts**: Line, bar, pie with legends.  
- **Notifications**: Toasts at top‑right.

**8. Responsive Behavior**  
- Desktop focus, with collapse‑to‑drawer behavior for smaller widths.

**Deliverables**  
- A full sitemap of the Super‑Admin console.  
- Annotated wireframes/mockups for:  
  1. Dashboard  
  2. Rewards & Wallet config & user‑impersonation  
  3. Booking Management screens  
  4. Partner/Commission settings  
  5. Campaigns list & editor  
  6. API README workspace  
  7. Audit Trail viewer  
- A component library spec (colors, typography, UI elements).  
- A high‑level UX flow diagram showing how an admin moves between modules and updates both UI config and API docs.

Produce a Figma‑style spec so that both UI developers and technical writers can implement the console and maintain API documentation seamlessly.
