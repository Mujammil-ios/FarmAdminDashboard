You are a senior full-stack engineer. Your task is to design and implement the “Farm Performance” feature for the Super-Admin of BookMyFarm. Follow these requirements precisely.

1. **High-Level Overview**  
   - The Super-Admin can view aggregate KPIs across all farms.  
   - The Super-Admin can drill down into any individual farm to see detailed performance metrics for a selected month.

2. **Global Dashboard (Landing Screen)**  
   - **KPI Cards (top row)**  
     1. Total Bookings (Last 7 days / 30 days / All time)  
     2. Total Revenue Collected (sum of customer payments)  
     3. Total Commission Earned (platform fees)  
     4. Average Review Score (aggregated across all properties)  
     5. Active Owners Count  
     6. Active Properties Count  
   - **Trend Chart**  
     - Line-chart showing daily bookings vs. cancellations over the past 30 days.  
   - **Top-5 Farms Table**  
     - Columns: Farm Name, Bookings (Last 7d), Revenue, Avg. Rating, Cancellation Rate.  
   - **Global Calendar Snapshot**  
     - Small inline month-view calendar with color dots (green = booked, red = cancelled, grey = free) for each day.

3. **Drill-Down: Individual Farm Performance Screen**  
   - **Header**  
     - Farm Name, Owner Name, Farm Type (Resort, Villa, etc.), Location  
   - **Monthly Calendar View**  
     - Full-width calendar for the selected month.  
     - Color-codes:  
       • **Green underline** under date = ≥1 successful booking  
       • **Red underline** under date = ≥1 cancellation  
       • **Blue underline** under date = ≥1 owner-side or offline booking  
       • **No underline** = no bookings  
     - Navigation arrows to move month-to-month.  
   - **Key Metrics for Month**  
     1. Total Bookings  
     2. Booking Revenue  
     3. Platform Commission  
     4. Occupancy Rate (%) = (days booked / total days)  
     5. Cancellation Rate (%) = (cancellations / bookings)  
     6. Average Lead Time = average days between booking and stay date  
     7. Average Review Score  
   - **Detailed Sections (tabs or accordion)**  
     - **Booking History**  
       • Table: Booking ID, Customer Name, Check-in Date, Check-out Date, Amount Paid, Status  
     - **Transactions**  
       • Table: Transaction ID, Date, Type (Customer Payment / Commission Disbursement), Amount, Balance Due to Owner  
     - **Reviews**  
       • List: Reviewer Name, Rating, Date, Comment  
     - **Owner Payouts**  
       • Table: Payout Date, Amount Paid Out, Outstanding Commission, Payment Method  

4. **Data
Use static data from a proper class not static on page data get data strucurezed from a serpate class

Dont use database in this projecdt


5. **UI/UX Deliverables**  
   - Provide wireframes for both the Global Dashboard and the Individual Farm screen.  
   - Include hover-tooltips on calendar cells explaining counts (e.g. “2 bookings, 1 cancellation”).  
   - Mobile-responsive behavior: collapse KPI cards into a carousel; calendar becomes scrollable.

6. **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - All KPI cards display accurate, up-to-the-minute data.  
   - Calendar colors update correctly when bookings/cancellations occur.  
   - Data tables support sorting and pagination.  
   - Navigation between global and per-farm screens works without page reload (SPA).  
   - Unit tests for API responses and UI components covering ≥80% code coverage.
